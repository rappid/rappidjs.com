# Understanding the Concepts of rAppid.js

// TODO

### Think in Components

In rAppid.js nearly everything, except of the data is a component. A component can be some service or manager which encapsulates business logic or a view which contains view logic for rendering a model or other attributes.

### Think in MVVM-Bindings 

Bindings will help you to keep the view in sync with the model. Therefor every view state should be represented by a data model somehow.

### Think in Standards

rAppid.js lets you use normal HTML elements and their native attributes combined with bindings. So you don't need to learn a whole new set of attributes. If you know HTML, you can start straight away.

### Think about Applications not Libraries 

The main goal of rAppid.js is to support you with everything you need for an application. That's why it comes with a lot of ready to use components that will help you to write clean maintainable code.
